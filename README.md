**Coffee Geek** is a cloud based app for tracking coffee tastings.

Even for those of us who *think* they love coffee, there is a world of (too much?) Information and detail to be found and explored.  This app was born of my geeky brother's love of coffee and spreadsheets.  It is a cloud based tracker for the Coffee Aficionado to log tastings, rate products, and research what others think - on the go!

This is the first full stack app I am producing! It has been an exciting process which has unified much of what I have learned in the past 10 weeks as a General Assembly Web Development Immersive.

**Coffee Geek** allows users to add or select a coffee from the database and then document tastings they have done with it. This includes tasting notes, extraction notes, grams in/out, rating, etc.

This GitHub page is the front end of the application.  The back end can be found here: https://github.com/rachaelmillerdesign/coffee-geek-backend.

This project has required me to build my first back end app, with a front end to match.  In doing so I have:



- Built a single-page application (SPA) with basic user authentication (sign up, sign in, sign out, change password) that interacts with a custom API built by me.

- Created an app that can create, read, update and delete data in an SQL base.

- Created user stories and wireframes as part of planning the app prior to coding.

Here is a diagram of the ERD:

Technologies used include:

**HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, JQuery, Ruby, Rails, JSON, SQL, Curl, API,**

<u>Possibilities for future refinement and development include:</u>

- ratings score card / visualizer
- 'card' style display for each coffee type with images
- ability to sort and retrieve subsets of information
- coffee brands can have multiple coffees
- user about me page
- ability to upload images of coffee
- types of equipment

- sorting capabilities
- search coffees and tastings
- view by rating and favorites
